# Compressor & Decompresso
@author "Kumar Prabhakar"

### Introduction 
This project aims to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression. This project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression. The benefits of reduction include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing. In this project, we will ensure that our compressed files can be restored to their original form.
